# Dedicated server devcommands

This client side mod allows devcommands for server admins.

Some commands require also installing the mod on the server (event, randomevent, resetkeys, setkey, skiptime, sleep, stopevent).

# Manual Installation:

2. Download the latest zip
3. Extract it in the \<GameDirectory\>\BepInEx\plugins\ folder.
4. Add your steamID64 to adminlist.txt (if not already).

Check [wiki](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Console_Commands) for available commands and how to use them.
